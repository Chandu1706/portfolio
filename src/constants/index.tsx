export const HERO_CONTENT = `Full-stack software engineer with 7+ years of real-time hands-on experience and 3+ years of industry work building accessible, performant apps. I specialize in React Native, Flutter, Python/FastAPI, and cloud-native architectures (AWS/Supabase). Iâ€™ve led teams and shipped production features across FlatZ (community platform), Verba.ai (iOS transcription), a GenAI virtual health assistant, and a Play-Store chess game. I love turning ideas into scalable, user-first products.`

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
Iâ€™m an engineer-builder who enjoys owning products end-to-endâ€”architecture, APIs, mobile UI/UX, CI/CD, and analytics. Recently Iâ€™ve focused on GenAI (LangChain, OpenAI/Claude, RAG) and iOS/React Native performance work. Outside code, youâ€™ll find me playing guitar, sketching, and, unsurprisingly, thinking three moves ahead over a game of chess.
